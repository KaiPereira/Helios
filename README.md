Helios is a small, solar powered LoRa weather station, in Pi Zero 2W form factor! It's designed for extremely low power consumption, small price, expandability and hobby purposes! It has a couple onboard sensors for temperature, humidity, pressure and light, but it's mostly designed to be your own little customizable node!
